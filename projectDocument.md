Authentication Flow
The system uses JWT-based authentication with the following flow:

Registration:

User submits registration form

Server validates input, hashes password

New user created in database

JWT token generated and set as HTTP-only cookie

Login:

User submits credentials

Server verifies email/password

JWT token issued with user role

Protected Routes:

Client includes JWT cookie in requests

Server verifies token and checks authorization

Role-based middleware enforces permissions

Session Management:

Automatic token refresh

Periodic auth state checks

Secure logout with token invalidation

Core Components

Manages authentication state

Provides user data throughout the app

Handles login/logout/registration

Role-based helper functions
